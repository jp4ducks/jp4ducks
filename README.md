Hi, I'm JP, a veteran C developer wishing to make my Second Wind.
During almost 15 years I developed mission critical applications, services and protocols for the BSS/OSS telecommunications market. 
Core processes: billing, mediation, provisioning, prepaid, fraud, roaming, and revenue assurance.
CRWAY, the Call Record Gateway was my opera prima, a real-time process to handle all the CDMA traffic on the Movicom Bellsouth mobile carrier network.
CRWAY was a finite state automata, or simply a state machine, like the Ethereum Virtual Machine that implemented a gateway.
This gateway, 100% implemented in ANSI-C,  decoded and translated X.25/HDLC packets into the IP network, using a Microgate SDLC Adapter.
The CRWAY grabbed an impressive uptime of 99.99%, less than 1 hour yearly downtime.

I'm firm believer of Decentralization as a way to develop our freedom

I'm currently learning Python and looking to collaborate in the blockchain distributed ecosystem.
